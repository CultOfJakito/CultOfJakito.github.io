# How to add stuff

First of all, you need python 3.8 or higher (and PIP) then run those 2 commands `pip install mkdocs` and `pip install mkdocs-material`.Clone the repo, then, to facilitate working with this, please take a look at [the configuration section here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#configuration)  
After that you can look at mkdocs's or mkdocs-material's documentation. Second, to see what your page in action, type `mkdocs serve` and go to `127.0.0.1:8000` on your browser.  
This website will be automatically reloaded everytime a change gets detected. When you are done, use `mkdocs gh-deploy` to deploy directly to GitHub.
