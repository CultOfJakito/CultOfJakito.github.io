# Prerequisites

To get started you're gonna need a few things:  

* ULTRAKILL (obviously).
* Some C# and/or Unity knowledge.
* Any C# IDE, but for this we recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).
* [BepInEx already set up](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/dev_guide/plugin_tutorial/1_setup.html).
