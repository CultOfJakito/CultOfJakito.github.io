# Before starting

To get started you're gonna need a few things:  

* Ultrakill (obviously)
* Some C# and/or Unity knowledge
* Visual Studio with support for C# installed or JetBrains Rider (VSCode or any other IDE can work but its easier to use Visual Studio)
* [BepInEx already setup](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/dev_guide/plugin_tutorial/1_setup.html)
